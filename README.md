Questioning the Status Quo
===========================
(through the looking glass) of Java, OOP and beyond
----------------------------------------------------

This work is the content for a talk about the current state of java enterprise development, 
evaluation of the available alternatives to conventional enterprise solutions, tools and languages for the JVM,
 and possibly beyond.

Based on personal experience and reasoning, I will try to verify where software development is going and how this is 
actually bound to where it's coming from.
